Circle Plots Analysis
====================

Overview
--------------------
Circle plots provide three complementary ways to visualize and understand cell-cell communication patterns in your data. Each visualization type offers a different perspective on how your cells interact with each other.

Global Circle Plot
--------------------

Purpose
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The global circle plot gives you a comprehensive view of how all cell types in your dataset communicate with each other. It's perfect for getting an initial overview of your cell-cell communication patterns.

Usage Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Select your CellChat object from the dropdown menu
2. Choose your visualization preference:
   - "Number of interactions" to see how many connections exist
   - "Interaction weights" to see the strength of communications
3. Click "Generate Plot" to create the visualization
4. Use "Download Plot" to save your results

Cell Type Specific Plots
--------------------

Purpose
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These plots focus on specific cell types of interest, showing their communication patterns in detail. This is useful when you want to examine particular cell populations more closely.

Usage Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Select your CellChat object
2. Choose the cell types you want to examine:
   - You can select multiple cell types
   - Each selected cell type will get its own visualization
3. Generate the plots to see detailed communication patterns
4. Download your results for further use

Chord Diagram
--------------------

Purpose
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Chord diagrams show directional communication between cell types, making it easy to see which cells are sending signals and which are receiving them. They are particularly useful for understanding pathway-specific interactions.

Usage Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Select your sender and receiver cell types
2. Choose specific signaling pathways if you want to focus on particular biological processes
3. Select display mode:
   - "Sending from selected" to focus on outgoing signals
   - "Receiving by selected" to focus on incoming signals
4. Generate and download your visualization

Best Practices and Tips
--------------------

Analysis Strategy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Start with the global circle plot to get an overview
- Use cell type specific plots to dive deeper into populations of interest
- Use chord diagrams when you want to understand directional communication
- Consider biological relevance when selecting cell types and pathways

Common Questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Which plot should I start with?
  Begin with the global circle plot for an overview, then use the others for detailed analysis

- How many cell types should I select?
  Start with a few key cell types of interest to keep visualizations clear

- What does the size of connections mean?
  Larger connections indicate stronger or more numerous interactions

- Can I compare between conditions?
  Yes, generate plots for each condition using different CellChat objects
