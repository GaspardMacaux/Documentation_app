# Ligand-Receptor Analysis

## Overview
This section creates CellChat objects from your data and identifies significant ligand-receptor communications between different cell types. You'll discover which cell types are communicating with each other and through which molecular signals.

## What You'll Do on This Tab
- **Create CellChat objects** by choosing how to group your cells
- **Run CellChat analysis** to identify significant communications
- **Visualize ligand-receptor interactions** between cell types using bubble plots
- **Customize plot appearance** for optimal visualization of your results

## Analysis Pipeline

### Step 1: Create CellChat Objects

**Choose Cell Grouping Column**
- Select the metadata column that contains your cell type names
- This is usually your cluster annotations (e.g., "seurat_clusters" or "cell_type")
- Each unique value in this column becomes a cell type for communication analysis

**Optional: Create Condition Subsets**
- Check "Create subset by condition" if you want to compare different experimental conditions
- Select condition column (e.g., "treatment", "timepoint", "disease_status")
- Creates separate CellChat objects for each condition to enable comparisons

**Create Objects**
- Click "Create Objects" to generate CellChat objects from your Seurat data
- System prepares expression data and cell type groupings
- Multiple objects created if condition subsets are enabled

### Step 2: Run CellChat Analysis

**Select Objects to Analyze**
- Choose which CellChat objects to process
- Can select multiple objects if comparing conditions
- All selected objects will be analyzed simultaneously

**Run Analysis**
- Click "Run Analysis" to identify significant ligand-receptor interactions
- Process calculates interaction probabilities between all cell type pairs
- Statistical testing determines significant communications
- Prepares data for visualization

### Step 3: Visualize Ligand-Receptor Communications

**Choose Analysis Results**
- Select which CellChat object results to visualize
- Choose from successfully analyzed objects

**Select Source and Target Cell Types**
- **Source cell types**: Cells that produce ligands (send signals)
- **Target cell types**: Cells that express receptors (receive signals)
- Multiple selections possible for both categories
- Leave empty to include all cell types

**Configure Interaction Filtering**
- **Threshold**: Statistical significance cutoff (default: 0.05)
  - Lower values = more stringent, fewer interactions shown
  - Higher values = more permissive, more interactions displayed
- **Probability cutoff**: Minimum interaction strength (0-1 scale)
  - Higher values focus on strongest communications
  - Lower values include weaker but potentially important signals

**Customize Plot Dimensions**
- **Plot width**: Adjust width in pixels for optimal display
- **Plot height**: Adjust height in pixels 
- Modify if bubble plot appears cramped or too spread out
- Consider number of cell types when setting dimensions

**Generate Bubble Plot**
- Click "Generate Plot" to create visualization
- Bubble plot shows communications between selected cell types

## Understanding Bubble Plot Results

### How to Read the Plot
- **X-axis**: Source cell types (ligand producers)
- **Y-axis**: Target cell types (receptor expressors)  
- **Bubble size**: Strength of the interaction
- **Color intensity**: Statistical significance level
- **Missing bubbles**: No significant interaction detected

### Interpreting Communications
**Strong Communications**:
- Large, dark bubbles indicate robust signaling
- High confidence in biological relevance
- Priority targets for further investigation

**Moderate Communications**:
- Medium bubbles suggest potential interactions
- May be context-dependent or tissue-specific
- Worth validating with additional data

**Pattern Recognition**:
- **Rows with many bubbles**: "Chatty" cell types that send many signals
- **Columns with many bubbles**: "Popular" targets that receive many signals
- **Diagonal patterns**: Autocrine signaling (cells talking to themselves)
- **Off-diagonal clusters**: Specific communication networks

### Interaction Information Tables

**All Interactions Table**
- Complete list of detected ligand-receptor pairs
- Shows source cell type, target cell type, ligand, receptor
- Includes statistical measures and interaction strength

**Interaction Type Summary**
- Counts of different communication categories
- Overview of signaling diversity in your system
- Helps identify dominant communication modes

## Practical Applications

### Research Questions Addressed
- **Which cell types communicate most actively?**
- **What signals do immune cells send to tissue cells?**
- **How do stem cells receive differentiation signals?**
- **Which communications are disrupted in disease?**

### Plot Optimization Strategies
**For Many Cell Types**:
- Increase plot dimensions
- Focus on subset of source/target types
- Use higher threshold to reduce complexity

**For Few Cell Types**:
- Decrease plot dimensions for better resolution
- Lower threshold to reveal more interactions
- Focus on specific signaling pathways

**For Condition Comparisons**:
- Generate plots for each condition separately
- Use consistent scaling and thresholds
- Compare interaction patterns between conditions

```{tip}
Start with default parameters and all cell types to get an overview, then focus on specific source-target pairs of interest. Adjust plot dimensions based on the number of cell types - more types need larger plots.

## Export and Documentation

**Available Downloads**:
- **Download Plot**: Save bubble plot in specified format and resolution

- Includes all statistical measures and interaction details

**Plot Formats**:
- PNG: Good for presentations and web display
- JPEG: Smaller file size, slight quality loss
- TIFF: High quality, larger files
- SVG: Vector format, scalable
- PDF: Publication-ready vector format

```{warning}
Large numbers of cell types can make bubble plots difficult to read. Consider focusing on specific cell type subsets or increasing plot dimensions for better visualization.
```

## Troubleshooting

**No interactions detected?**
- Check if ligand and receptor genes are expressed in your data
- Lower the significance threshold
- Verify cell type annotations are correct
- Ensure sufficient cells per cell type

**Plot appears cramped?**
- Increase plot width and height
- Focus on subset of cell types
- Consider rotating axis labels

**Too many interactions to interpret?**
- Increase significance threshold
- Focus on strongest interactions (higher probability cutoff)
- Analyze specific cell type pairs separately

**Unexpected interaction patterns?**
- Validate with known biology and literature
- Check for batch effects or technical artifacts
- Consider cell type annotation accuracy

## Quality Control Checks

### Validation Steps
- **Check known interactions**: Do expected communications appear?
- **Literature validation**: Are novel interactions biologically plausible?
- **Expression validation**: Are ligands/receptors actually expressed?
- **Statistical review**: Are significance levels appropriate?

### Common Issues
- **Over-interpretation**: Not all statistical interactions are biologically meaningful
- **Missing context**: Consider tissue-specific and developmental contexts
- **Technical artifacts**: Batch effects can create false interactions
