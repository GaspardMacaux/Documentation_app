Introduction
==========================

Welcome to our Single-Cell and Single-Nucleus RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq) data analysis application. The data you will be exploring are produced using 10x Genomics technology, a cutting-edge method for genome-wide profiling of single cells and nuclei. This allows us to analyze gene expression at the level of a single cell or nucleus, offering unprecedented resolution for understanding biological mechanisms. This application utilizes the Seurat and Monocle libraries. Seurat is a popular R tool for scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq analysis. It offers a suite of tools for quality, analysis, exploration, and visualization of such data.Monocle provides a trajectory analysis that helps us to analyse the fate of cells.

This application allows anyone who is not familiar with computer code to use many of the functions of these libraries, thereby democratising the analysis of this type of data.
We hope you will find this application useful and informative. Happy exploring!
