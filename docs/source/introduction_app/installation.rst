Accessing the Application
-------------------------

Once you have run the Docker container using either the Docker Desktop interface or the command line, you can access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to ``http://localhost:3838``.

.. note::
  ``http://localhost:3838`` is the URL where the application is hosted on your local machine. 
  - ``localhost`` refers to your own computer 
  - ``3838`` is the port number where the application is running

If the application doesn't load, make sure that the Docker container is running and that you have typed the URL correctly in your web browser.
