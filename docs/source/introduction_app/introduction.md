# Overview

Welcome to our integrated single-cell RNA sequencing analysis platform. This application empowers researchers to analyze complex single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data through an intuitive graphical interface. Whether you're studying cell populations, developmental trajectories, or cell-cell interactions, our platform provides the tools you need without requiring programming expertise.

## Platform Capabilities

Our application integrates four powerful analysis frameworks:

**Seurat: The Core Analysis Engine**
* Comprehensive quality control and preprocessing
* Advanced cell clustering and visualization
* Robust integration of multiple datasets
* Marker gene identification
* Differential expression analysis

**CellChat: Cell Communication Analysis**
* Inference of cell-cell communication networks
* Prediction of ligand-target interactions

**Monocle: Developmental Dynamics**
* Reconstruction of cellular trajectories
* Pseudo-time analysis
* Cell fate mapping and lineage tracing
* Identification of branch points and cell state transitions


## Analysis Pipeline

Our streamlined workflow guides you through each step of single-cell analysis:
