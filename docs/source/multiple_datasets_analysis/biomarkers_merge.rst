Cluster Biomarkers
==========================

Identifying cluster-specific biomarkers is essential for distinguishing between different cell types or states within integrated datasets. Biomarkers are genes that are uniquely or highly expressed in a particular cluster, serving as molecular signatures for those clusters.

**Understanding Biomarkers:**

Biomarkers are characteristic genes whose expression levels are indicative of specific biological states or cell types. In the context of clustering, biomarkers help:

- Differentiate between clusters by their unique gene expression profiles.
- Understand the functional properties of different cell populations.
- Identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention or further study.

**How to Identify and Use Cluster Biomarkers:**

1. **Biomarker Discovery:** Use differential expression analysis to find genes that are significantly upregulated in a cluster compared to others. These genes are potential biomarkers for the cluster.
2. **Validation:** Validate identified biomarkers by cross-referencing with known marker genes from literature or reference datasets.
3. **Visualization:** Use visualization tools like Feature Plots and Heatmaps to display the expression patterns of biomarkers across clusters.

.. tip::
   Prioritize biomarkers that are not only differentially expressed but also have known biological relevance to the clusterâ€™s presumed identity.

.. warning::
   Some biomarkers may be influenced by technical noise or batch effects. Validate findings with multiple datasets or experimental replicates.

**Applications of Biomarkers:**

- **Diagnostic and Therapeutic Target Identification:** Biomarkers can serve as diagnostic indicators or therapeutic targets in disease contexts.
- **Functional Analysis:** Biomarkers provide clues about the functional roles of different cell types or states.
