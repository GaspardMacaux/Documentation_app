Clustering Multiple Datasets
==========================

Clustering is a critical step in single-cell RNA sequencing analysis that helps identify distinct cell populations based on gene expression profiles. In the context of multiple datasets, clustering allows for the discovery of shared and unique cell types across different conditions or experiments.

**Understanding Clustering:**

Clustering involves grouping cells that exhibit similar gene expression patterns. This process is essential for:

- Identifying different cell types or states within a dataset.
- Understanding the heterogeneity of cell populations.
- Revealing insights into biological processes and cellular responses.

**How Clustering Works in an Integrated Dataset:**

1. **Dimensional Reduction:** Before clustering, the integrated dataset undergoes dimensionality reduction using techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection). This step reduces the complexity of the data while retaining its most informative features.

2. **Graph-Based Clustering:** After dimensional reduction, a graph-based clustering algorithm (such as Louvain or SLM) is applied. This method constructs a graph where cells are nodes, and edges represent the similarity between cells. The algorithm partitions the graph into clusters based on these similarities.

3. **Resolution Parameter:** The resolution parameter controls the granularity of the clustering. A higher resolution value will result in more clusters, potentially identifying more subtle subpopulations, whereas a lower resolution value will result in fewer, broader clusters.

.. tip::
   Adjust the resolution parameter to find the optimal number of clusters for your analysis. Start with a moderate value and adjust based on the clustering results and biological relevance.

.. warning::
   Over-clustering can lead to artificial splits within cell types, while under-clustering may overlook biologically distinct populations. Use biological knowledge and marker gene expression to validate clusters.

**Interpreting the Results:**

- After clustering, each cell is assigned to a cluster. These clusters can be visualized using UMAP or PCA plots, which provide a spatial representation of the data.
- Clusters are color-coded, allowing for easy identification of distinct cell populations.
