Clustering Multiple Datasets
==========================

### Overview

Clustering is a critical step in single-cell RNA sequencing analysis that helps identify distinct cell populations based on gene expression profiles. In the context of multiple datasets, clustering allows for the discovery of shared and unique cell types across different conditions or experiments.

### Understanding Clustering

Clustering involves grouping cells that exhibit similar gene expression patterns. This process is essential for:

- Identifying different cell types or states within a dataset.
- Understanding the heterogeneity of cell populations.
- Revealing insights into biological processes and cellular responses.

### How Clustering Works in an Integrated Dataset

1. **Dimensional Reduction**:  
   Before clustering, the integrated dataset undergoes dimensionality reduction using techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection). This step reduces the complexity of the data while retaining its most informative features.
   
   - **Run Scaling, PCA, and Elbow Plot**:  
     Click "Run Scaling, PCA, and Elbow Plot" to perform scaling and PCA on the integrated dataset. This step identifies the most variable features and reduces the data to its principal components.
     - The **Elbow Plot** will be generated to help determine the optimal number of principal components to use for downstream analysis.

2. **Find Neighbors and Run UMAP**:  
   - After determining the number of dimensions to use from PCA, input this number in the "Number of dimensions" field.
   - Click "Find Neighbors and run UMAP" to perform neighborhood graph construction and UMAP dimensional reduction.
   - This step prepares the data for clustering by defining the local neighborhood structure of the cells.

3. **Graph-Based Clustering**:  
   After dimensional reduction, a graph-based clustering algorithm (such as Louvain or SLM) is applied.
   - **Select Algorithm**: Choose the clustering algorithm to use (e.g., Original Louvain, Louvain with Multilevel Refinement, or SLM Algorithm).
   - **Set Resolution**: The resolution parameter controls the granularity of the clustering. A higher resolution will result in more clusters, potentially identifying more subtle subpopulations.
   - Click "Find clusters" to apply the clustering algorithm and partition the cells into clusters.

.. tip::  
   Adjust the resolution parameter to find the optimal number of clusters for your analysis. Start with a moderate value and adjust based on the clustering results and biological relevance.

.. warning::  
   Over-clustering can lead to artificial splits within cell types, while under-clustering may overlook biologically distinct populations. Use biological knowledge and marker gene expression to validate clusters.

### Interpreting the Results

- **UMAP Plot**:  
   After clustering, each cell is assigned to a cluster. These clusters can be visualized using the UMAP plot.
   - The clusters are color-coded, allowing for easy identification of distinct cell populations.
   - Use the checkboxes to remove axes or the legend for a cleaner visualization.
   - The UMAP plot can be downloaded by clicking "Download UMAP" and adjusting the DPI as needed.

### Troubleshooting

- **Error During Scaling or PCA**:  
   Ensure that the integrated dataset is correctly loaded and that the data contains sufficient variability for PCA.

- **Clustering Results Do Not Match Expectations**:  
   Adjust the resolution parameter or choose a different clustering algorithm. Validate the clusters using known marker genes or biological insights.

By following these steps, you can effectively perform clustering on integrated single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, enabling the identification of distinct cell populations across different conditions or experiments.
