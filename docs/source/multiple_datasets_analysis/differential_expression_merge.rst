Differentially Expressed Genes
==========================

Identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) is a powerful method to understand the molecular mechanisms that distinguish different cell types or conditions in your datasets. DEGs can provide insights into the unique functional properties of each cluster.

**Concept of Differential Expression:**

Differential expression analysis involves comparing gene expression levels between different groups of cells (e.g., different clusters or conditions) to identify genes that are significantly upregulated or downregulated.

**Key Steps in Differential Expression Analysis:**

1. **Normalization:** Data is normalized to account for differences in sequencing depth and other technical variations.
   
2. **Statistical Testing:** A statistical test (e.g., Wilcoxon rank-sum test) is applied to identify genes that are differentially expressed between clusters or conditions. This test calculates a p-value to assess the significance of the observed differences.

3. **Thresholding:** Users can set thresholds for the log fold change and minimum percentage of cells expressing the gene to refine the list of DEGs.

.. tip::
   Use a higher log2 fold change threshold to identify the most biologically relevant DEGs. Consider adjusting the p-value threshold to control for false discovery rates.

.. warning::
   Be cautious with low p-value thresholds as they may result in many false positives. Always validate DEGs with additional experiments or literature evidence.

**Interpreting DEG Results:**

- A table of DEGs is generated, showing genes that are significantly upregulated or downregulated between the specified groups.
- The table includes key metrics such as log fold change, p-value, and percentage of cells expressing the gene.

**Applications of Differential Expression Analysis:**

- **Biomarker Discovery:** Identify potential biomarkers for specific cell types or disease states.
- **Functional Annotation:** Understand the roles of different genes and pathways in cellular processes.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Compare gene expression profiles across different conditions or experimental setups.
