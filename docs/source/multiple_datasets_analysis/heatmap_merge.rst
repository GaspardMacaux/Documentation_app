Heatmaps
==========================

Heatmaps are powerful visualization tools that display the expression levels of selected genes across different clusters or conditions. They are particularly useful for identifying patterns of gene expression that are consistent or variable across multiple datasets.

**Understanding Heatmaps:**

Heatmaps provide a matrix-like visualization where each row represents a gene, and each column represents a cluster or sample. The color intensity represents the level of gene expression, allowing for quick identification of expression patterns.

**How to Create and Interpret Heatmaps:**

1. **Gene Selection:** Choose genes that are relevant to your analysis or are known markers for specific cell types.
2. **Cluster Selection:** Select clusters or conditions to include in the heatmap. You can focus on specific clusters or include all clusters to compare across the entire dataset.
3. **Customization:** Adjust heatmap settings such as color gradients, clustering methods, and ordering of rows and columns to enhance interpretability.
4. **Interpretation:** Use heatmaps to identify clusters with similar expression patterns, distinguish cell types, and explore gene co-expression.

.. tip::
   Use hierarchical clustering options within the heatmap to group similar genes or clusters together, making patterns easier to identify.

.. warning::
   Be cautious when selecting too many genes or clusters, as this can result in dense heatmaps that are difficult to interpret. Focus on a subset of the most informative genes.

**Applications of Heatmaps:**

- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify clusters or conditions with unique gene expression signatures.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Compare gene expression across different clusters or datasets to understand biological differences and similarities.
