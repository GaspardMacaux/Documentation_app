Load Datasets
==========================

In this section, you will learn how to load multiple datasets into a unified analysis environment. Integrating datasets is crucial when dealing with single-cell RNA sequencing data from different sources or conditions. It allows you to perform a comprehensive analysis that considers all datasets as a single entity, enabling direct comparisons and joint analysis.

**Concept of Data Integration:**

Data integration in the context of single-cell RNA sequencing involves combining multiple datasets (e.g., from different experiments or conditions) into a single cohesive dataset. This process is necessary to:

- Reduce batch effects and technical variations that may arise from different sequencing runs.
- Increase the statistical power by pooling cells from multiple datasets.
- Enable a unified analysis across different conditions or experimental setups.

**Key Steps in the Integration Process:**

1. **Data Loading:** The initial step involves loading Seurat objects or 10X data files, which are standard formats for single-cell RNA sequencing data. This step converts raw data into a format that can be processed and analyzed.
   
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** After loading, the data is cleaned to remove low-quality cells or genes that might introduce noise into the analysis.

3. **Normalization and Scaling:** The datasets are normalized to account for sequencing depth and scaled to ensure that highly variable genes are prioritized in the downstream analysis.

4. **Integration:** This step involves finding shared features (anchor points) across datasets and aligning them into a common space. The result is a single integrated dataset that can be analyzed as a whole.

.. tip::
   Use Seurat objects saved in `.rds` format for faster loading and processing. Ensure that the data is properly formatted and pre-processed before integration to minimize errors.

.. warning::
   Improperly formatted datasets or those from different species may cause integration errors or produce misleading results. Always check dataset compatibility before integrating.

**Instructions for Loading Datasets:**

1. Prepare your datasets in `.rds` or `.gz` format.
2. Select the appropriate dataset type (snRNA-seq, Multiome, or Seurat Object).
3. Upload the datasets into the platform using the provided interface. The system will handle decompression and initial checks.
