Subset
==========================

Subsetting your data allows you to focus on specific cell populations or conditions for a more targeted analysis. This approach is beneficial when dealing with large datasets or when interested in a particular subset of cells.

**Concept of Subsetting:**

Subsetting involves selecting a specific portion of the data based on certain criteria, such as cluster identities or gene expression levels. This process is useful for:

- Focusing on specific cell types or states within a dataset.
- Reducing data complexity to enhance the clarity of subsequent analyses.
- Conducting targeted analyses on specific cell populations or conditions.

**How to Create and Use Subsets:**

1. **Cluster-Based Subsetting:** Select clusters of interest based on their biological relevance or experimental focus.
2. **Gene Expression-Based Subsetting:** Define subsets based on the expression levels of specific genes or sets of genes. This is useful for isolating cells with particular molecular characteristics.
3. **Subsetting Tools:** Use the provided interface to define subsetting criteria and create new Seurat objects for the subsets.
