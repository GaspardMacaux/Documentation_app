LR Activity Plot
==========================

Overview 
--------
The LR (Ligand-Receptor) Activity Plot visualizes the strength of ligand-receptor interactions between cell populations in your dataset.

Creating Your Plot
----------------

1. **Basic Settings**
  * Select your group from dropdown menu
  * Choose number of top interactions (default: 50)
  * More interactions = more detail but busier plot

2. **Optional Filtering**
  * Select specific sender cells (optional)
  * Select specific receiver cells (optional)
  * Helps focus on interactions of interest

3. **Generate & Export**
  * Click "Generate Plot" button 
  * Set resolution for export (300 DPI recommended)
  * Download plot in TIFF format

Understanding the Plot
--------------------
The plot shows:
  * Ligand-receptor pairs on axes
  * Interaction strength by color
  * Connection patterns between cells
  * Key signaling relationships

Best Practices
------------
* Start with all populations to get overview
* Filter to specific cells for detailed view
* Use 300+ DPI for publication
* Check all interactions make biological sense

.. tip::
  If plot looks too crowded, reduce number of interactions shown.

.. note::
  Export in high resolution (300+ DPI) for publication quality figures.
