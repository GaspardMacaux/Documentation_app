Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs)
===========================================

Overview
--------------------
Identifying **Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs)** is essential for understanding the biological differences between cell clusters or experimental conditions. DEGs are genes that show statistically significant differences in expression between groups of cells.

Parameters and Their Impact
--------------------

Log Fold Change (logFC)
--------------------
- Definition: Measures expression difference between groups on logarithmic scale
- Interpretation:
  * logFC of 1 = gene expressed 2x more
  * logFC of 2 = gene expressed 4x more
  * Negative values indicate lower expression
- Typical Thresholds:
  * Conservative: > 0.5
  * Standard: > 0.25
  * Permissive: > 0.1

Percentage Threshold
--------------------
- Purpose: Controls minimum cell expression requirement
- Settings:
  * Strict (25%): More confident results
  * Standard (10%): Balanced approach
  * Permissive (1%): Captures rare expression
- Impact: Higher values reduce false positives
