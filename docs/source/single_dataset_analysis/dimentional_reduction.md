# Dimensional Reduction

## Overview
Single-cell RNA sequencing data typically contains thousands of genes (dimensions) per cell. Dimensional reduction helps visualize and analyze this complex data by reducing it to a manageable number of dimensions while preserving important biological relationships.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Theory and Importance
- **What is PCA?**
  * Mathematical technique to reduce data dimensionality
  * Transforms correlated variables into uncorrelated principal components
  * Each PC captures maximum remaining variance in the data
- **Why Use PCA?**
  * Reduces computational complexity
  * Removes technical noise
  * Highlights main sources of variation
  * Facilitates visualization and clustering

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Data Scaling
- **Purpose**: Normalize gene expression variation
- **Process**:
  * Centers gene expression to mean 0
  * Scales to unit variance
- **Why Important**: 
  * Prevents highly expressed genes from dominating
  * Makes genes comparable

### 2. PCA Calculation
- Click "Scale Data & PCA"
- Application automatically:
  * Scales the data
  * Calculates principal components
  * Generates visualizations

### 3. Output Visualization
- **PCA Results Table**:
  * Shows variance explained by each PC
  * Lists cumulative variance
- **Loading Plot**:
  * Shows gene contributions to PCs
  * Helps identify influential genes

## Determining Optimal PC Number

### Elbow Plot Analysis
- **What it Shows**:
  * Y-axis: Variance explained
  * X-axis: Principal components
  * "Elbow" indicates diminishing returns

- **How to Interpret**:
  1. Look for sharp bend ("elbow")
  2. Consider cumulative variance
  3. Balance detail vs. noise

## Recommendations

- **Typical Ranges**:
  * scRNA-seq: 10-30 PCs
  * snRNA-seq: 15-40 PCs
  * Complex tissues: May need more
- **Factors to Consider**:
  * Dataset size
  * Cell type heterogeneity
  * Biological complexity
  * Analysis goals

> **Tip: Best Practices**
> * Start with standard range (10-30 PCs)
> * Adjust based on elbow plot
> * Consider biological complexity
> * Document your choice for reproducibility

> **Warning: Common Pitfalls**
> * Too few PCs: Loss of biological signal
> * Too many PCs: Including noise
> * Ignoring elbow plot: Suboptimal analysis
> * Not considering dataset specifics
