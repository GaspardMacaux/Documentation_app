Dimensional Reduction
==========================

### Overview
Single-cell RNA sequencing data typically contains thousands of genes (dimensions) per cell. Dimensional reduction helps visualize and analyze this complex data by reducing it to a manageable number of dimensions while preserving important biological relationships.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

#### Theory and Importance
- **What is PCA?**
  * Mathematical technique to reduce data dimensionality
  * Transforms correlated variables into uncorrelated principal components
  * Each PC captures maximum remaining variance in the data

- **Why Use PCA?**
  * Reduces computational complexity
  * Removes technical noise
  * Highlights main sources of variation
  * Facilitates visualization and clustering

#### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Data Scaling**
   - **Purpose**: Normalize gene expression variation
   - **Process**:
     * Centers gene expression to mean 0
     * Scales to unit variance
   - **Why Important**: 
     * Prevents highly expressed genes from dominating
     * Makes genes comparable

2. **PCA Calculation**
   - Click "Scale Data & PCA"
   - Application automatically:
     * Scales the data
     * Calculates principal components
     * Generates visualizations

3. **Output Visualization**
   - **PCA Results Table**:
     * Shows variance explained by each PC
     * Lists cumulative variance
   
   - **Loading Plot**:
     * Shows gene contributions to PCs
     * Helps identify influential genes

### Determining Optimal PC Number

#### Elbow Plot Analysis
- **What it Shows**:
  * Y-axis: Variance explained
  * X-axis: Principal components
  * "Elbow" indicates diminishing returns

      :align: center

- **How to Interpret**:
  1. Look for sharp bend ("elbow")
  2. Consider cumulative variance
  3. Balance detail vs. noise

#### Recommendations
- **Typical Ranges**:
  * scRNA-seq: 10-30 PCs
  * snRNA-seq: 15-40 PCs
  * Complex tissues: May need more

- **Factors to Consider**:
  * Dataset size
  * Cell type heterogeneity
  * Biological complexity
  * Analysis goals

.. tip::
   **Best Practices**
   * Start with standard range (10-30 PCs)
   * Adjust based on elbow plot
   * Consider biological complexity
   * Document your choice for reproducibility

.. warning::
   **Common Pitfalls**
   * Too few PCs: Loss of biological signal
   * Too many PCs: Including noise
   * Ignoring elbow plot: Suboptimal analysis
   * Not considering dataset specifics

### Quality Control Checks

#### Signs of Good Quality
- Clear elbow in variance plot
- Smooth decline in explained variance
- Biologically relevant gene loadings

#### Red Flags
- No clear elbow
- Very low variance explained
- Unusual patterns in loadings

### Troubleshooting Guide

Problem | Possible Cause | Solution
--------|---------------|----------
No clear elbow | High data complexity | Consider biological context
Low variance explained | Poor data quality | Review QC metrics
Batch effects dominate PCs | Technical variation | Consider batch correction
Strange loading patterns | Data quality issues | Check gene expression

### Advanced Considerations

1. **Batch Effects**
   - Look for batch-related PCs
   - Consider batch correction if needed
   - Monitor technical covariates

2. **Cell Cycle Effects**
   - Identify cell cycle-related PCs
   - Decide whether to regress out
   - Balance biological vs. technical

3. **Gene Selection**
   - Impact of variable features
   - Consider biological pathways
   - Monitor key marker genes
