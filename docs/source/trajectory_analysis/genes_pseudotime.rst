Genes Pseudotime
==========================

The "Genes Pseudotime" tab focuses on identifying differentially expressed genes along the inferred trajectory, allowing for the exploration of gene dynamics over pseudo-time. This analysis can reveal genes that play crucial roles at different stages of a biological process.

Understanding Genes Pseudotime Analysis

Genes Pseudotime Analysis is used to identify and visualize genes whose expression levels change along the trajectory. These changes provide insights into the molecular mechanisms driving the biological process represented by the trajectory.

Key Steps in Genes Pseudotime Analysis

1. **Differential Expression Analysis Along Trajectory:**
   - After ordering cells in pseudotime, differential expression analysis is performed to identify genes that vary significantly along the trajectory.
   - The `graph_test` function in Monocle identifies genes differentially expressed along the principal graph, highlighting key drivers of the biological process being studied.

2. **Gene Dynamics Visualization:**
   - Selected genes can be visualized along the trajectory to understand their expression dynamics over pseudotime.
   - The `plot_cells` function visualizes gene expression on the trajectory plot, showing how different genes are expressed across the inferred pseudotime.

3. **Gene Module Analysis:**
   - Gene modules, which are groups of co-expressed genes, can be identified along the trajectory.
   - The `find_gene_modules` function identifies these modules, allowing exploration of coordinated expression patterns.

.. tip::
   Select genes with significant q-values and fold changes to focus on the most impactful genes in the trajectory.

.. warning::
   Ensure that the trajectory and pseudotime ordering are biologically meaningful before interpreting gene expression changes.

How to Analyze Genes in Pseudotime

1. **Calculate Differential Genes:** Click the "Run Differential Gene Test" button to compute differentially expressed genes along the trajectory.
2. **Visualize Gene Trajectory:** Select genes from the picker and click "Visualize Gene Trajectory" to see how their expression changes along the pseudotime.
3. **Gene Module Analysis (Optional):** Perform module analysis to identify gene modules and visualize their dynamics.
4. **Genes Along Path:** Choose genes and cell types to visualize gene dynamics along a specific path in the trajectory.
