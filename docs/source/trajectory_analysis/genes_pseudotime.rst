Genes Pseudotime
==========================

The "Genes Pseudotime" tab focuses on identifying differentially expressed genes along the inferred trajectory, allowing for the exploration of gene dynamics over pseudo-time. This analysis can reveal genes that play crucial roles at different stages of a biological process.

**Understanding Genes Pseudotime Analysis:**

Genes Pseudotime Analysis is used to identify and visualize genes whose expression levels change along the trajectory. These changes provide insights into the molecular mechanisms driving the biological process represented by the trajectory.

**Key Steps in Genes Pseudotime Analysis:**

1. **Differential Expression Analysis Along Trajectory:**
   - After ordering cells in pseudotime, differential expression analysis is performed to identify genes that vary significantly along the trajectory. These genes are often key drivers of the biological process being studied.
   - The `graph_test` function in Monocle is used to identify genes that are differentially expressed along the principal graph.

2. **Gene Dynamics Visualization:**
   - Selected genes can be visualized along the trajectory to understand their expression dynamics over pseudotime. This helps in identifying the stages at which specific genes are upregulated or downregulated.
   - The `plot_cells` function can be used to visualize gene expression on the trajectory plot, showing how different genes are expressed across the inferred pseudotime.

3. **Gene Module Analysis:**
   - Gene modules, which are groups of co-expressed genes, can be identified along the trajectory. These modules often represent functional groups of genes that work together in the biological process.
   - The `find_gene_modules` function identifies these modules, which can be visualized to explore the coordinated expression patterns.

.. tip::
   Select genes with significant q-values and fold changes to focus on the most impactful genes in the trajectory.

.. warning::
   Ensure that the trajectory and pseudotime ordering are biologically meaningful before interpreting gene expression changes.

**How to Analyze Genes in Pseudotime:**

1. **Calculate Differential Genes:** Click the "Run Differential Genes" button to compute differentially expressed genes along the trajectory.
2. **Visualize Gene Trajectory:** Select genes from the picker and click "Visualize Gene Trajectory" to see how their expression changes along the pseudotime.
3. **Gene Module Analysis:** Click "Run Module Analysis" to identify gene modules and visualize their dynamics.

**Applications of Genes Pseudotime Analysis:**

- **Identify Key Drivers:** Discover key genes involved in cell differentiation or disease progression.
- **Understand Gene Function:** Explore how gene function changes across different stages of a biological process.
- **Pathway Analysis:** Identify pathways that are active at different points along the trajectory, providing insights into the underlying biology.
