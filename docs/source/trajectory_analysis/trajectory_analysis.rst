Trajectory Analysis
==========================

Trajectory Analysis is a powerful tool used to infer the developmental trajectory of cells from single-cell RNA sequencing data. This analysis helps in understanding differentiation paths and uncovering dynamic changes in gene expression over pseudo-time.

### Concept of Trajectory Analysis

Trajectory Analysis involves mapping cells along a continuum representing a biological process, such as differentiation, cell cycle progression, or response to stimuli. The goal is to order cells in a way that reflects their progression through a biological process, allowing for the identification of intermediate states and transitions between cell types.

### Key Steps in Trajectory Analysis

1. **Data Preparation and Conversion:**
   - Begin by loading a Seurat object containing single-cell RNA sequencing data.
   - Convert the Seurat object into a Monocle object, which is specifically designed for trajectory analysis. This is achieved using Monocle, an R toolkit for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data and reconstructing cell trajectories.

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - Construct a graph representing the manifold of cells in a reduced dimensional space (e.g., UMAP). This graph captures potential developmental paths.
   - Use `cluster_cells` to cluster cells in the UMAP space and `learn_graph` to construct a principal graph that represents the backbone of the developmental trajectory.

3. **Root Cell Selection and Pseudotime Ordering:**
   - Select a root cell, which represents the starting point of the trajectory. This is often a stem or progenitor cell from which differentiation begins.
   - Once the root cell is chosen, cells are ordered in pseudotime, reflecting their progression through the developmental process.

.. tip::
   Use known biological markers to select an appropriate root cell to ensure that the trajectory aligns with known biological processes.

.. warning::
   Incorrect root cell selection can lead to misleading trajectory inference. Always validate the trajectory with biological knowledge.

### How to Perform Trajectory Analysis

1. **Load the Seurat Object:** Start by uploading a Seurat object containing your single-cell data.
2. **Convert to Monocle Object:** Click on the "Convert to Monocle" button to transform the Seurat object into a Monocle object.
3. **Construct the Graph:** Use the "Construct Graph" button to create a principal graph that represents the developmental trajectory.
4. **Select the Root Cell:** Click on the "Select root cell" button, and choose a root cell on the UMAP plot.
5. **Order Cells in Pseudotime:** Confirm the root cell selection to order the cells along the trajectory.

### Applications of Trajectory Analysis

- **Developmental Biology:** Understand the differentiation pathways of stem cells into various lineages.
- **Disease Progression:** Explore how diseases, such as cancer, evolve at the cellular level.
- **Drug Response:** Study how cells change in response to drug treatments over time.
